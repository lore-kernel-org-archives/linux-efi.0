Yes, it is untested but not sure that it is wrong...  It all depends on
how we add SEV support to the guest UEFI BIOS.  My take would be to have
the EFI data and ACPI tables encrypted.

I like the idea of limiting the differences but it would leave the EFI
data and ACPI tables exposed and able to be manipulated.

We haven't discussed Windows guests under SEV yet, but as you say, we
need to do things the same.
