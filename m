This patch set makes QEMU fw_cfg blobs available for viewing (read-only)
via SysFS.

New since v1:

    1/3:

	- renamed sysfs path components:

		s/fw_cfg/qemu_fw_cfg/g, at Greg's suggestion
		
		s/by_select/by_key/g since it feels a bit more intuitive

	- attribute "select" renamed to "key", along the same train of
	  thought.

	- renamed actual source file from "fw_cfg.c" to "qemu_fw_cfg.c"
	  and doc file in Documentation/ABI/testing to
	  "sysfs-firmware-qemu_fw_cfg"

	- s/uintXX_t/uXX/g, at Greg's suggestion

	- using named identifiers to initialize access mode table
	  (static struct fw_cfg_access fw_cfg_modes[]) per Greg's
	  suggestion

	- removed redundant "capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)" checks (per Greg's
	  feedback)

    2/3:

	- EXPORT_SYMBOL(kset_find_obj) statement moved immediately
	  after kset_find_obj() definition.

Re. 'struct device' vs. straight-up kobject:

I dug around a bit, and found a bunch of stuff under /sys/devices
(such as e.g. /sys/devices/virtual/dmi and /sys/devices/platform/applesmc)

The first one is particularly interesting, as it presents a
somewhat different view of the same internal information displayed by
/sys/firmware/dmi/, only /sys/devices/virtual/dmi looks more "cooked",
in that it exposes individual fields of the several different DMI tables.

None of the subfolders of /sys/devices/... appears to facilitate access
to the "raw blobs" contained by the respective devices represented there.

Even applesmc (the other device with which I'm somewhat familiar) does
a lot of "cooking" of the values held by the device.

So, at the end of the day, I want the information I expose about fw_cfg
to look more like /sys/firmware/dmi than like /sys/devices/virtual/dmi
in that I have a bunch of cached metadata attributes for each of the
blobs, and want to offer access to the raw blob data, and there's no
rhyme or reason to the actual internals of any of the blobs, so offering
a "cooked" view like in /sys/devices/... doesn't feel like the best fit...

Obviously, I may be totally wrong... :)

Lastly, re. Greg's comment on patch 3/3:
> Shouldn't all of this be done in userspace with the symlinks and all?
> It seems like you are trying to duplicate the /dev/block/by-name and
> such.  Policy decisions like symlinks and naming should be done there,
> in userspace, and not directly in sysfs if at all possible.

OK, so here's the "pseudo-bash" equivalent of what this patch does:

	#upon successful qemu_fw_cfg.ko insertion

	BY_KEY="/sys/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg/by_key"
	BY_NAME="/sys/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg/by_name"

	mkdir -p $BY_NAME

	for KEY in $(ls $BY_KEY); do
		FILE=$(cat $BY_KEY/$KEY/name)
		[ mkdir -p $BY_NAME/$(dirname $FILE) ] || continue
		pushd $BY_NAME/$(dirname $FILE)
		ln -s $BY_KEY/$KEY $(basename $FILE)
		popd
	done

Note how it MAY fail to mkdir, in which case it skips to the next key,
or it MAY fail to create the symlink, in which case it just moves on
to the next key as well.

Again, the fw_cfg device doesn't have any notion of nested directories,
it just parrots back some random string someone choose as a name for a
given blob, but these strings typically contain slash-separated ASCII
which "looks like" it "could" be a path name :)

If there's a reasonable way to do this dynamically, immediately upon
insertion of the qemu_fw_cfg.ko module, patches 2/3 and 3/3 could be
dropped.

But before that, I'd appreciate a pointer to how/where this can be done
in userspace. Would it be available e.g. during early boot, early enough
to e.g. raw-dump an ASCII blob containing shell variable definitions (e.g.
to set hostname on the guest, etc ?)

Doing it as part of the qemu_fw_cfg.ko module itself has the advantage
of it being available immediately, without anything having to "watch"
for the module being inserted.

But if userspace is the standard, "canonical" place to do something like
this, I'd be happy to give it a try, once I find the right tree to bark
up on... :)

Thanks much,
   Gabriel
