There is a new Transparent SME mode that is now part of the overall
SME support, but I'm not alluding to that in the documentation at all.
In TSME mode, everything that goes through the memory controller would
be encrypted and that would include EFI data, etc.  TSME would be
enabled through a BIOS option, thus allowing legacy OSes to benefit.

This patch assumes that the EFI regions of a guest would be encrypted.
